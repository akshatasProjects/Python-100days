# Dictonaries in Python

- It works same as a Objects in JS
  {key:value}

- A dictionary is a collection of unordered, modifiable(mutable) paired (key: value) data type

## Dictionary Length

- It checks the number of 'key: value' pairs in the dictionary.
- You can access the dictionary value by putting the keyName inside square brackets [keyName]
- when using numbers as key dont need to put the "" around it.
- To add new key value to the existing dictionary then dictionary_name["newKey"]="Value"
- To clear the dictionary completely dictionary_name = {}

for thing in ditionary:

print(thing) -- gives only key value
